  /* When a create a variable using final keyword that variable becomes a runtime constant but when we create a variable   
using const keyword the variable becomes a compile time constant so we typically use final when we don't know what a     
value will be at compile time for example if we need to fetch some data and store it in a variable or if the value of a   
variable depends on the return value of some other function then we might use the final keyword. So we would use const   
when we do know the value of a variable at compile time and that's gonna be setting stone from the very begnning. */
